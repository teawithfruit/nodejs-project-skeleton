#Node.js Project Skeleton

The idea is to build a skeleton of a project, that you make able to start instantly with a new Node.js project.
It includes functionality for using koa, handlebars, sass and nodemon if one of the files you work on is edited.

##How to use
First of all you have to install some global modules.

```
gem install compass
npm install -g nodemon bower gulp

```
If it's done, you only have to run the following three steps, to get your skeleton running.

```
npm install
gulp install
gulp

```
At least you only have to run gulp.

```
gulp

```

Happy coding. :)
